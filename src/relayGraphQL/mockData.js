We have truly helped transform some of our talented members' lives by giving them great long term work with amazing companies.\n\n## How we work\n\nAt Flexhire, we work using the kanban approach for project management and small iterations on features, getting early feedback from end users. In our fully remote team, everyone makes a difference: we all have a \"horizontal\" shaped skillset and take ownership of different aspects of the product.\n\n- You will work directly with our CEO Brian, to help shape our evolving product and make decisions as a team.\n- We try to foster both the development of new skills, for example learning the backend for our frontend engineers, but we also encourage our engineers to specialize and take ownership of what they do best.\n- We use an async communication style based on Slack chats, with mentions/pings used to get the immediate attention of people when necessary. We also have daily 10-minute standup video meetings to keep in touch with the team as a whole.\n- We encourage pair programming sessions using screen sharing over a video meeting for the people for which this kind of collaboration works well.\n\n## Tech stack\n\nOur product is built on a modern stack and a combination of best practice solutions, with custom ones when the best practice does not fit us.\n\n- You will work on a modern codebase that is regularly maintained and refactored to match the product's growth and scale, and to take advantage of the ideal tech to power the information deep, highly interactive UI of Flexhire.\n- We have a Rails application as our backend, and a hybrid SPA with Server Side Rendering and PWA features as our frontend. Our frontend is built using the Next.js framework, React, Typescript, Material-UI and a GraphQL API with the Relay client. We also make heavy use of React hooks both from libraries and our own custom ones.\n- The Rails backend and the Next.js frontend communicate through a GraphQL API and we have automations in place to ensure type safety so Typescript types are automatically generated for the GraphQL queries on the frontend, thanks to the Relay client.\n- Our infrastructure is deployed on AWS with redundant, horizontally scaled servers. The deployments are managed through automated CI and CD pipelines, and we also have multiple comprehensive suites of all kinds of automated tests to keep us moving fast without breaking things. Finally, we stay on top of user facing issues through deep Sentry integration and LogRocket.\n- Our engineering team has a flat, horizontal structure so you will be encouraged to get to know all the different aspects of the product, or to specialize in specific functional areas in the codebase and product.",
